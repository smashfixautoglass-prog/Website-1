SmashFix Auto Glass — One-page Website (Covington / Conyers, GA)

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- logo.svg (placeholder)
- README.txt (this file)

Quick setup instructions:
1) Replace logo.svg with your real logo file. Keep the filename 'logo.svg' or update <img src=""> in index.html.
2) Replace hero-placeholder.jpg with a real job photo (or remove the img tag). For best local SEO, name photos like 'windshield-replacement-covington.jpg'.
3) Update the email in the contact form handler (script.js) from info@smashfixautoglass.com to your real email address. The form uses a mailto fallback to open the user's email client. If you want form submissions via web, you can use Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a backend endpoint.
4) Upload the files to your host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your web host). If you use GitHub Pages, push the folder to a repo and enable Pages. If you use a traditional web host, upload the files to your public_html or www directory.
5) For faster lead-tracking, install CallRail or use a Google forwarding number and update the tel: links in index.html.
6) To improve SEO: add separate service pages later, add alt text for images, and publish weekly GMB posts linking to service pages.

If you'd like, I can:
- Swap the placeholder images for sample before/after images.
- Add a working form that posts to Formspree or Netlify Forms (I will set it up so you don't need a backend).
- Create a GitHub Pages-ready repo and push these files for you.
